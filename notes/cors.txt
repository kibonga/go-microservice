1. Same-Origin policy
Browsers implement same-origin policy, which ensure that scripts running on web page(origin)
cannot access data from another origin

2. CORS - (cross-origin resource sharing)
Allows the nerf of the same-origin policies under controlled conditions
Server can specify who can, and under what conditions access resources

3. Default Access Restriction
By default a script can make a HTTP request to different domain
However the browser restricts the script to access response headers, unless the server
explicitly allowed it
If a header is not in the "Exposed headers" list, the script cannot access that header


/////////////////
Allow Credentials
By default when making cross-origin HTTP requests, web apps do not send any credentials(cookies, HTTP auth, SSL certs) in the request
When AllowCredentials is set, the CORS config on the server will accept any relevant credentials from the browser
